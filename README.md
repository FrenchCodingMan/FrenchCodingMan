<h3 align="left"> About Me </h3>
<p>I first learned swift because I liked ios, then flutter, with the mvvm architecture. Then I gave up because I didn't have any freelance assignments and the prospects were poor with flutter. Companies need native developers for complex projects.

I'm very attracted to web3, the world of crypto and blockchain, but I don't want to make the same mistake as in the past of learning a niche language.

My main objective is to find a job, which is why I'm focusing on Python because it's multi-language and offers me more opportunities.</p>

<h2 align ="left">Why i choose Python</h2>

<p>Python is a beginner-friendly programming language, it's the best language to start programming, it's the most permissive and generalist of all programming languages.

Currently in Thailand, I happened to accompany my friend who is a French teacher in Thailand to an elementary school. He let me manage his students for 2 hours, without any intervention on his part.
I loved this experience, working in contact with children, having the role of transmitting information, awakening their intellectual curiosity, but also having responsibilities and having to look after them.

In this context, I really enjoyed teaching, and I had a vision following this experience: if I'm lucky enough to become a programmer, I'd like in the future to become a programming teacher for children, and it's easier to teach a language like python, which is generalist and logical, than to teach a niche programming language.</p>
